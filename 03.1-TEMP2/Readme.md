### How to run TEMP2

Here for each population we run TEMP2 independently

This information is also available at:

```
/beegfs/project/mosquites/aalbo1200g/TEMP2Loops/
```

and 

```
/beegfs/project/mosquites/aalbo1200g/TEMP2Loops/CombineLibrary
```

The latter contain a run of TEMP2 with the masked F5 using the combine library of MCHelper and Manually curated library
